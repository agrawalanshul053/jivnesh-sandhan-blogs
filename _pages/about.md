**Who I am**  
I'm an engineer going [wide and deep](https://github.com/amitness/learning) on the multidisciplinary fields of data science.

**What I do**  
I apply Machine Learning research to industry problems at [Fusemachines](https://fusemachines.com) . I've worked in domains of education, health-care, logistics and market research.

**Interest Areas**  
I'm interested in the paradigm of learning with limited labels ([Self-Supervised Learning](https://amitness.com/categories/#self-supervised-learning) / [Semi-Supervised Learning](https://amitness.com/categories/#semi-supervised-learning)) and [Natural Language Processing](https://amitness.com/categories/#nlp).

**About this blog**  
I write posts with hand-drawn diagrams and intuitions to clarify various machine learning concepts. I personally find such visual explanations very helpful to link the big picture with the actual details and mathematics involved.
