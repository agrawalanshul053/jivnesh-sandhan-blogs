In this blog, I explain machine learning concepts using diagrams, animations, and intuition.  

**About Me**  
I'm passionate about applying Machine Learning to industry problems.

I began my career as a software engineer but transitioned to data science through rigorous [self-study](https://github.com/amitness/learning).

I worked as a Machine Learning Engineer at [Fusemachines](https://fusemachines.com) where I built NLP capabilities for a consumer research product from ground zero.

Currently, I am back to grad school pursuing an MS in Computational Linguistics at [CIMEC](https://www.cimec.unitn.it/en).

**Research Interests**  
I'm interested in research areas that focus on learning with limited labels and Natural Language Processing.
