**Who I am**  
I'm a T-shaped engineer going [wide and deep](https://github.com/amitness/learning) on the multidisciplinary fields of data science.

**What I do**  
Currently, I work as a Machine Learning Engineer at [Fusemachines](https://fusemachines.com), where I apply state-of-the-art research to solve business problems. I've worked in domains of education technology, health-care, logistics and market research.

**Interest Areas**  
I'm interested in the paradigm of learning with limited labels (Self-Supervised Learning / Semi-Supervised Learning) and Natural Language Processing.

**About this blog**  
I write posts with hand-drawn diagrams and intuitions to clarify various machine learning concepts. I personally find such visual explanations very helpful to link the big picture with the actual details and mathematics involved.

**Get Connected**  
If you find my work interesting, let's get connected on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/amitness).
