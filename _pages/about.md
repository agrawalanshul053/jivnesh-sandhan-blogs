In this blog, I explain machine learning concepts using diagrams, animations, and intuition.  

**About Me**  
I'm an engineer passionate about applying Machine Learning to real-world industry problems.

I initially started my career as a software engineer but transitioned to data science through rigorous [self-study](https://github.com/amitness/learning).


**Now**  
Currently, I am pursuing an MS in Computational Linguistics at [CIMEC](https://www.cimec.unitn.it/en).

Previously, I worked as a Machine Learning Engineer at [Fusemachines](https://fusemachines.com) where I built NLP capabilities for a market research platform from ground zero.

**Research Interests**  
I'm interested in the paradigm of learning with limited labels and Natural Language Processing.
