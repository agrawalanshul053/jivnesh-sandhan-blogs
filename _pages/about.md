**About Me**  
Hi I'm Jivnesh sandhan. I am a fourth year Ph.D. at the Department of Electrical Engineering, IIT Kanpur. I completed my dual degree in Mathematics department of IIT Kanpur in 2018.

My Research Supervisor is Dr. Laxmidhar Behera. I am interested in Natural Language Processing for Sanskrit Computational Linguistics. I am currently working on developing a deep-learning based solutions for downstream tasks for Sanskrit, namely, compound type classification, word segmentation, morphological parsing, dependency parsing and poetry to prose conversion.

<!-- Prior to that, I worked as a Machine Learning Engineer at [Fusemachines](https://fusemachines.com) where I built production-level NLP capabilities for a consumer research product from ground zero.

I initially began my career as a software engineer but transitioned to data science through rigorous [self-study](https://github.com/amitness/learning). -->
