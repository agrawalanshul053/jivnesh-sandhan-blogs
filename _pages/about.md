In this blog, I explain machine learning concepts using diagrams, animations and intuition.  

**Who I am**  
I'm an engineer going [wide and deep](https://github.com/amitness/learning) in the multidisciplinary fields of data science.

**What I do**  
I currently apply Machine Learning research to industry problems at [Fusemachines](https://fusemachines.com) . 

**Interest Areas**  
I'm interested in the paradigm of learning with limited labels ([Self-Supervised Learning](https://amitness.com/categories/#self-supervised-learning) / [Semi-Supervised Learning](https://amitness.com/categories/#semi-supervised-learning)) and [Natural Language Processing](https://amitness.com/categories/#nlp).
