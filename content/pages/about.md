### Who I am

Hi, I'm Amit Chaudhary and I live in Kathmandu - Nepal.

I'm  a T-shaped engineer exploring the multidisciplinary fields of applied data science, one at a time.


### What I do

I'm trained in data science and machine learning through fellowships from Microsoft and Fusemachines and a Micromasters from Columbia University. I've been applying the data skills to highlight evidence-based issues for a non-profit organization "Code For Nepal".

As a software engineer at Insight Workshop, I engineer products for varying business domains all the way from the early prototypes to delivery to the user at scale. The full-stack culture at the company has provided me with excellent software engineering skills.

I'm AWS certified with proficiency designing architectures in the cloud.
