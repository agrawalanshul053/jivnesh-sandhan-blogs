### Who I am

Hi, I'm Amit Chaudhary and I live in Kathmandu - Nepal.

### What I do

I'm currently working as a software engineer. 

I love working with systems that have many moving parts so naturally I gravitated towards full-stack software development. 

### About this blog

The goal of this blog is to talk about things that I'm working on.
