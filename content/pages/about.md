**Who I am**  

Hi, I'm Amit Chaudhary and I live in Kathmandu - Nepal.  
  
I'm  a T-shaped engineer exploring the multidisciplinary fields of applied data science, one at a time.

<br>
**What I do**  

Currently, I work as a Machine Learning Engineer at [Fusemachines](https://fusemachines.com), where I help businesses impart intelligence into their products.  
<br>
I'm trained in data science and machine learning through fellowships from Microsoft and Fusemachines and a [Micromasters](https://www.edx.org/micromasters/columbiax-artificial-intelligence) from Columbia University. I've been applying the data skills to highlight evidence-based issues for a non-profit organization "[Code For Nepal](https://codefornepal.org/)".  
<br>
Previously, I've worked as a software engineer to build products for varying business domains all the way from the early prototypes to delivery to the user at scale.  
<br>
Besides my core skills in data, I'm also AWS certified with proficiency leveraging cloud for scaling up services.

**About this blog**  

The goal of this blog is to talk about things that I'm passionate about.
