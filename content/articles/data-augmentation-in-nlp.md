Summary: An overview of data augmentation techniques for NLP
Status: draft
Authors: Amit Chaudhary

Unlike Computer Vision where using image data augmentation is a standard practice, augmentation of text data in NLP is pretty rare. This is because trivial operations for images like rotating an image a few degrees or converting it into grayscale doesn't change its semantics. This presence of semantically invariant transformation is what made augmentation an essential toolkit in Computer Vision research.

I was curious if there were attempts at developing augmentation techniques for NLP and read up the existing literature. Through this post, I will share my findings and give an overview of current approaches being used for augmenting text data.
